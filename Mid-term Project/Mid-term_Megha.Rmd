**_Boston Celtics was founded in 1946 as one of the original eight NBA teams. The team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The homeground of Celtics is the TD Garden in Boston. Curious about the effect of weather on the spectator attendance at the Regular Season home games of the Celtics in the years 2012-2016, we scraped the attendance data from the ESPN website and began exploring the data. Since Basketball is an indoor game, there may be other major factors, other than weather, that could affect the spectator attendance at each game. Therefore, we explored the effect of the popularity of the opponent team on game attendance._**

#Collected data on opponent team from the ESPN website

BCeltics <- read_excel("C:/Users/GP/Desktop/MEGHA/RGitHub/MA615/Mid-term Project/BCeltics.xlsx")

**_The attendance for each game has been plotted above and it shows that the overall attendance percentage is above 85%. There are small variations in the attendance that may be because of the popularity of the opponent team_**


```{r}

#checking if having a star player in the opponent team has an effect on attendance
legend_tilte <- "Opponent Star Player"
ggplot(BCeltics)+

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  scale_color_manual(legend_tilte, values = c("palegreen3", "plum4"))
  
```
**_The plot shows that the presence of a star player in the opponent team is accompanied with a higher attendance compared to not having a star player in the opponent team._**


```{r}

#Grouping the data by the opponent team and year

```
**_We can see that the plot for Boston Celtics Vs Popular Teams has a slightly higher attendance (above 17000), comapred to Boston Celtics Vs Less Popular Teams. Though it is not a large variation, spectators seem to enjoy games between popular teams more. Existing rivalry between the teams does not seem to have much effect on spectator attendance. Notice that the game Celtics Vs Denver Nuggets in 2015 has an unusually low attendance. This may be because the Celtics lost the previous four games (as shown in the table below)._**
