A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to know how many pages in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints. Make an n x k table that shows the probability that n or fewer pages in a 50 page book will have more than k misprints.Show and explain your work. Include equations and calculations to teach the reader how to solve the problem. Include an image of a book.


_The printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. The misprints follow a poisson distribution. Therefore, the probability that a page will have more than k misprints is given by:_

$$P(X > k) = 1 - P(X\leq k) = 1 - \sum_{x=0}^{k}\frac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!}$$
_Since $\lambda$ is 2, we have_
$$P(X > k) = 1 - \sum_{x=0}^{k}\frac{2^xe^{-2}}{x!}$$

_The probability that n or fewer pages in the 50 page book will have more than k misprints is given by_      
$$P(Y\leq n) = {50\choose k}\sum_{j=0}^{n}(1 - \sum_{x=0}^{k}\frac{2^xe^{-2}}{x!})^j(\sum_{x=0}^{k}\frac{2^xe^{-2}}{x!})^{n-j}$$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("C:/Users/GP/Desktop/MEGHA/RGitHub/MA615/book1.png") #Including image of a book
```


_The n x k table for the probabilities of fewer than n pages having more than k misprints is as follows:_

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prob2 <- matrix(c(rep(0,500)),nrow = 50, dimnames = list(c("n<=1",2:50), c("k > 0",1:9)))
prob1 <- c()
 for (n in 1:50){
for (k in 0:9){
  prob1[k] <- 1 - ppois(k, lambda = 2) #for probabilities of more than k misprints
  prob2[n,k] <- pbinom(n, 50, prob = prob1[k]) #for probabilities of n or fewer pages having k misprints
 }
}  
df <- as.data.frame(prob2)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra) 
kable(df, digits = 5, align = 'c') #table containing the probabilities
```
